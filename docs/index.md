# Welcome to Twilio Wrapper Library

Twilio Wrapper Library is just written for the purpose to bring a new level of ease to the developers who deal with Twilio into their system.

The initiative of this library is based on the demand to write a module for website solutions that implements a feature which in turn enables the end users of the system to call their dedicated customer support line directly.

> **Here's a simple scenario:**

> - A end user visits your website. e.g. `http://www.example.org`
> - He navigates through the pages and comes to have some questions to ask.
> - Although there's customer contact page on the website, he sees a form from which he can initiate a call directly.
> - He puts his number and click the 'call' button, he will receive a follow up call on his phone.
> - Upon acceptance of the call, he will be friendly directed to customer support line.

## So what does it do exactly?

> - Built a wrapper class that wraps all twilio-related operations such as `Service Initialization`, `Making a Call`, `Generating Twiml callback response`, etc.
> - It provides a rich set of configuration parameters.
> - That's it! Developers can intialize this wrapper class obejct with his specific details (incl. Twilio credentials) and just do what he wants in a breeze.
